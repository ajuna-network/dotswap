# Dotswap.org Summer 2024 Testing 

Dotswap.org ([link](https://dotswap.org)) is a new Asset Hub DEX UI developed by MVP Workshop and supported + hosted by Colorful Notion.  

dotswap.org aims to be a full-fledged interface for users to manage Asset Hub-related assets (DOT, USDT, USDC, DED, PINK, to start), with key functionality of swapping assets using a new assetConversion pallet on Asset Hub, as well as basic gateway between Asset Hub and the Relay Chain (v1) and major parachains and Ethereum (v2). 

## Earn up to $100 USDT for testing and providing feedback on Dotswap.org

We are doing a round of *usability testing* in Summer, where everyday Polkadot community members can earn up to $100 for testing and providing feedback.
